			<h3 class="left-right">“I see it as a badge of enlightenment that one recognises things that are systemically wrong in society and calls them out in order to fix them”</h3>

			<h3 class="left-right">"The fight against discrimination can take extreme forms, which may themselves constitute discrimination"</h3>
			<h3 class="right-left">"The term 'woke' has become prominent in our lexicon, especially over the last few years with the rapid polarization and us vs. them rhetoric that has taken over our country."</h3>
			<h3 class="left-right">These days, it has become almost fashionable for people to telegraph just how aware they have become... It means wanting to be considered correct, and wanting everyone to know just how correct you are.</h3>
			<h3 class="right-left">"It suggests to white allies that if they walk the walk, they get to talk the talk."</h3>
			<h3 class="left-right">"Those who try to signal their wokeness by saying 'woke' have revealed themselves to be very unwoke indeed."</h3>

					<p>"I’ll be talking with another white friend and, when race or racism comes up, I start to feel competitive about knowing more than them or being the better white person. I either judge them for knowing less than me or judge myself for not knowing as much as them."</p>
					<p>"I’m from the South, and often, it’s not hard to be wokest white person in the room. Living in Brooklyn and being around other white people who know more about anti-racism than me is new, and I’m constantly reminding myself to push my ego to the side."</p>
					<p>"At some point, he might be asked to 'check his privilege,' to acknowledge the benefits that accrue to him as a white man. At first, it’s humiliating — there’s no script for taking responsibility for advantages that he never asked for and that he can’t actually revoke. But soon, his discomfort is followed by an urge to announce his newfound self-awareness to the world. He might even want some public recognition, a social affirmation of the work he has done on himself."</p>
					<p>"Instead of trying to prove how much I know, the best thing I can do to demonstrate that I’m trying to 'stay woke' is to listen to others, and to constantly ask myself where I may be making assumptions or judgments about others that don’t explore the full story of that individual. Staying woke."</p>

				<div class="up up1">
					<p>"The word has now been recycled by people hoping to add splashes of drama to their own inconsequential obsessions, tweeting 'Raptors will win it all #STAYWOKE' or 'new bio ... #staywoke.' The new iteration of radical chic is the guy on Tinder who calls himself a 'feminist artist in Brooklyn' and then says he’s 'looking for the you-know-what in the you-know-where' — the performance of 'wokeness' is so conspicuous that it breeds distrust."</p>
					<p>"'Woke' now works as a dig against those who claim to be culturally aware and yet are, sadly, lacking in self-awareness."</p>
					<p>"'Woke Olympics,' a “kind of contest” in which white players compete to 'name racism when it appears' or condemn 'fellow white folk who are lagging behind.'</p>
					<p>"The latest revolution of 'woke' doesn’t roll its eyes at white people who care about racial injustice, but it does narrow them at those who seem overeager to identify with the emblems and vernacular of the struggle."</p>
					<p>"Being an ally means speaking up on behalf of others — but it often means amplifying the ally’s own voice, or centering a white person in a movement created by black activists, or celebrating a man who supports women’s rights when feminists themselves are attacked as man-haters."</p>

		<h1>FINAL WORDS</h1>

			<div class="up up2">
				<p>Black podcast producer and writer, Erianna: "Y’all arguing about this is goofy... 'You don’t have the real life experience to be condescending.'"</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;"Erianna talked about how white people are afforded the privilege of 'over-education' and was amused that we would ever be competitive with one another or try to out-woke each other. Because, she said, we have no actual lived experience of racist oppression, which trumps whatever we’re reading."</p>
				<p>"To be woke is to understand the unique kind of exhaustion that comes from being perpetually attuned to discrimination. It is to be weary and wary. To be woke is to long for a day when one doesn’t have to stay woke."</p>
				<p>"'Woke' is not intended to be used as a measurement of how enlightened or ignorant a person is. It is not a metric of one’s levels of racism or anti-racism. It is about being willing to reflect honestly on our own lenses, and to challenge others to do the same, so we can shine a light on systemic issues and practices that keep some people in a one-up position in our society and some in a one-down status."</p>
